# Jubilee Austen Website - *website project*
**A sample website that incorporates HTML5 and CSS**

## General info

This is a project of a sample website.  It incorporates all of the HTML5 and CSS.  This website features a one page layout.  It comes with a navigation menu at the top to link to the *About*, *Work*, and *Contact* sections.  There are links in the *Contact* section as well, which takes the user to my social media and *'Github'* pages.  There is also a link to my email address.

The purpose of this project was to build a simple website from the ground up.  Much attention was given to teaching the value of organized code.  This provided plenty of practice with HTML best practices, with a focus on accurate syntax that was validated.  It was also great practice with CSS code, and with page layouts.

At the time, this was my first real website I coded and launched.  I was able to learn how to acquire a domain, which is now my personal portfolio website, and is linked below under *Contact*.  Also, I learned to use an FTP to get the content live on the internet. I was motivated to persevere through this early project, to see a site through to its finish.  By sticking with it, I was able to refine my skills greatly.  I learned it takes dedication and hard work to see good results. It was great to see this website completed, and showed me how far I had come. I would like to revisit this more in the future, to make further adjustments.
